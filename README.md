> **Welcome to QClass24/25 that runs from Sep 2024 to May 2025. During Fall 2024 we will offer an introductory course on quantum computing, programming, and algorithms. The plan for Spring 2025 will be announced later.**


Our QClass is fully virtual and free, but the registration is mandatory. All tutorials will be open-sourced and publicly available. Starting from high school (not younger than 14 years old) all students as well as graduated people are welcome to apply for joining QClass24/25. We plan to accept around 1000 students.

We will review _programming with Python_ and _basic trigonometry & liner algebra_ at the beginning of class, which are the only prerequisites to follow our content.

## Main program

We have an introductory level course in the Fall semester.

*   **QCourse101-2: Fundamentals of Quantum Computing & Programming**  
    _3 ECTS, undergraduate level, 14 weeks from Sep 9 to Dec 22_  
    *   Review of python, mathematics, & quantum mechanics.
    *   Basics of classical and quantum systems. Superposition & measurement. Operations on real-valued qubits.
    *   Entanglement, superdense coding, and quantum teleportation.
    *   Bloch sphere and complexed-valued quantum operators.

Remark that you can get credits only from the programs you are officially enrolled. So, you should communicate with your program advisor if they could give credits from our QCourses or activities. You can refer them this page for the details of QCourses.

## Tutorials

For the lectures, we use 
- [QBook101](https://qworld.net/qbook101/), based on QWorld’s tutorials 
- [Bronze-Qiskit](https://gitlab.com/qworld/bronze-qiskit), 
- [Nickel](https://gitlab.com/qworld/nickel), and 
- [Silver](https://gitlab.com/qworld/qeducation/educational-materials/silver-qcourse511).


## Schedule for Autumn semester

The online lectures will be held at 18:00-20:00 (Latvia) on Mondays, and the online labs will be held at at 18:00-20:00 (Latvia) on Wednesdays.

We follow a strict deadline policy.

Attendance to the lectures or labs is not mandatory, and the students can access class materials asynchronous. However, we highly recommend each student attend the online lectures and labs, be active in the class server, and synchronized with the course schedule.
